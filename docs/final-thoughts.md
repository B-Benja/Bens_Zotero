You made it!

You finished setting up Zotero in the way **_I_** use it. Start adding literature, and explore many functionalities we did not yet discuss – such as the newly added PDF reader. Depending on your working style, you maybe also want to tweak settings. Don’t hesitate to share your tips and tricks or contact me, if you have any questions.

Last but not least, don’t forget to support the fantastic project by [Getting Involved With Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/getinvolved). Of course, you can also support the development of useful plugins, like [Better BibTex]( https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/sponsoring/) or [ZotFile]( http://zotfile.com/).
