## Case Converter
Right-click on the 'Title' field on the right side after selecting an item to convert it to 'Title Case', 'Sentence Case', or 'BBT sentence case'.

## Colaboration & Zotero Groups
Zotero Groups is a handy feature that allows you to work on collaborative projects. I don’t use this feature, but you can find more information on the official [Zotero website](https://www.zotero.org/groups/).


## Full-Text Cache
The [website](https://www.zotero.org/support/preferences/search) describes Full-Text cache as follows: Zotero creates an index to allow the full text contents of PDF and plain-text attachments in your library to be searched with Quick Search (“Everything” option) and Advanced Search (via “Attachment Content”).

You can change the maximum limit of characters and pages to be indexed in 'Preferences - Search - Full-Text Cache'. If indexing runs into problems, you can also rebuild the index or deactivate it altogether ('Clear Index' and 'Maximum characters to index per file' set to 0).
