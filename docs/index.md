# Introduction

Zotero is an open-source bibliography and citation manager. It helps you collect, store and organize literature, export citations to Latex or Word, and many more handy features.

Here you can read how to use Zotero (more precisely, how **_I_** use it) and read about some useful tweaks and plugins to improve quality of life. Do not get discouraged by the wall of text. After getting the hang of it, Zotero saves time and will make your (research) life more manageable.

## To Zotero or not to Zotero, that is the question
If you are doing a Ph.D. or other research-related work, you have probably already asked yourself how to organize all the literature. There are many different tools out there. They have advantages and disadvantages, making it impossible to provide the perfect tool for everyone. In the end, it boils down to personal preference. The reasons I settled with Zotero are:

- [x]	Open source

    Zotero is fully open source and benefits from all its advantages: if the team ever abandons the project, new developers could step in; and of course, you can contribute as well)

- [x]	Free & non-profit
  
    Zotero is free. You can buy additional online storage, but that is not necessary. I will explain how to host everything locally or in your own cloud. 

- [x]	Popular & a big community
  
    Many handy plugins exist, and the community is very active and helpful.

- [x]   Availability

    Available for most systems: use it on Mac, Windows, and Linux

- [x]	Excellent citation style support

    Almost any style needed exists or can be implemented.


I hope I have got your attention now!
